# Natural Disasters Intensity Analysis and Classification using Artificial Intelligence


In this project i have used several libraries to predict whether the given image is a cyclone,wildfire,earthquake,flood.

I created frontend with homepage,introduction page and webcam page

->homepage contains data about cyclone,wildfire,earthquake,flood.
->introduction page tells about the diasaster management.
->webcam page gives realtime experience for an image
